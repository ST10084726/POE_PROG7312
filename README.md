## Introduction
This project is intended to enhance user engagement by integrating gamification elements into your application by learning the Dewey Decimal System. It provides feedback, rewards, and notifications based on user performance, such as scores, achievements, and badges. Gamification can be applied to various domains, including educational platforms, quizzes, games, and more.

## Troubleshooting:
### My score is not updating after I submit the quiz. What should I do?
 Verify that the quiz submission process is completed. Some quizzes may require a server-side process to calculate and update scores. 
 If the issue continues, it could be a technical problem with the quiz platform. Contact the quiz administrator or support team for help.

## FAQ
```bash
<br /> Q - How can I prepare for the quiz effectively?

           with all the answers that you can review before taking the quiz.

<br /> Q -  Can I retake the quiz if I don't perform well on the first attempt?
<br /> A - Yes, you can click the restart button.

<br /> Q - What do I do if I encounter technical issues during the quiz, such as a system crash or a sudden internet disconnect?
<br /> A - If you experience technical issues during a quiz, immediately contact your instructor or the quiz administrator to explain the situation.
           They will provide guidance on how to proceed, which may include granting an extension or a retake opportunity, depending on the circumstances.
           It's essential to communicate the issue as soon as possible.
