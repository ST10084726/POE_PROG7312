## Troubleshooting:
### My score is not updating after I submit the quiz. What should I do?
 Verify that the quiz submission process is completed. Some quizzes may require a server-side process to calculate and update scores. 
 If the issue continues, it could be a technical problem with the quiz platform. Contact the quiz administrator or support team for help.
### The Timer is not Displaying Correctly
 If you're facing issues with the timer display, ensure that your system clock is accurate. The timer relies on system time, and any discrepancies can affect its performance. Additionally, check for any conflicting processes that might interfere with the timer functionality.

## FAQ
```bash
<br /> Q - How can I prepare for the quiz effectively?
<br /> A - Before you click on the quiz label, there is a label underneath it that says "Answers," which will bring up a pop-up window
           with all the answers that you can review before taking the quiz.

<br /> Q -  Can I retake the quiz if I don't perform well on the first attempt?
<br /> A - Yes, you can click the restart button.

<br /> Q - What do I do if I encounter technical issues during the quiz, such as a system crash or a sudden internet disconnect?
<br /> A - If you experience technical issues during a quiz, immediately contact your instructor or the quiz administrator to explain the situation.
           They will provide guidance on how to proceed, which may include granting an extension or a retake opportunity, depending on the circumstances.
           It's essential to communicate the issue as soon as possible.

<br /> Q - Can I pause the timer during the quiz if I need to take a break?
<br /> A - Unfortunately, the timer runs continuously once you start the quiz and cannot be paused. It is designed to add a time constraint to the quiz, enhancing the challenge. Make sure to plan your time effectively before starting the quiz.

<br /> Q - Is there a penalty for incorrect answers in the quiz?
<br /> A - No, there is no penalty for incorrect answers. The purpose of the quiz is to assess your knowledge, and you are encouraged to attempt all questions. The timer, however, adds an element of urgency to the game, so try to answer as accurately and quickly as possible.
